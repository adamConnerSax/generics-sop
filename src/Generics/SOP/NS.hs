-- * Datatypes

-- | An n-ary sum.
--
-- The sum is parameterized by a type constructor @f@ and
-- indexed by a type-level list @xs@. The length of the list
-- determines the number of choices in the sum and if the
-- @i@-th element of the list is of type @x@, then the @i@-th
-- choice of the sum is of type @f x@.
--
-- The constructor names are chosen to resemble Peano-style
-- natural numbers, i.e., 'Z' is for "zero", and 'S' is for
-- "successor". Chaining 'S' and 'Z' chooses the corresponding
-- component of the sum.
--
-- /Examples:/
--
-- > Z         :: f x -> NS f (x ': xs)
-- > S . Z     :: f y -> NS f (x ': y ': xs)
-- > S . S . Z :: f z -> NS f (x ': y ': z ': xs)
-- > ...
--
-- Note that empty sums (indexed by an empty list) have no
-- non-bottom elements.
--
-- Two common instantiations of @f@ are the identity functor 'I'
-- and the constant functor 'K'. For 'I', the sum becomes a
-- direct generalization of the 'Either' type to arbitrarily many
-- choices. For @'K' a@, the result is a homogeneous choice type,
-- where the contents of the type-level list are ignored, but its
-- length specifies the number of options.
--
-- In the context of the SOP approach to generic programming, an
-- n-ary sum describes the top-level structure of a datatype,
-- which is a choice between all of its constructors.
--
-- /Examples:/
--
-- > Z (I 'x')      :: NS I       '[ Char, Bool ]
-- > S (Z (I True)) :: NS I       '[ Char, Bool ]
-- > S (Z (I 1))    :: NS (K Int) '[ Char, Bool ]

-- | A sum of products.
--
-- This is a 'newtype' for an 'NS' of an 'NP'. The elements of the
-- (inner) products are applications of the parameter @f@. The type
-- 'SOP' is indexed by the list of lists that determines the sizes
-- of both the (outer) sum and all the (inner) products, as well as
-- the types of all the elements of the inner products.
--
-- An @'SOP' 'I'@ reflects the structure of a normal Haskell datatype.
-- The sum structure represents the choice between the different
-- constructors, the product structure represents the arguments of
-- each constructor.

-- | The type of injections into an n-ary sum.
--
-- If you expand the type synonyms and newtypes involved, you get
--
-- > Injection f xs a = (f -.-> K (NS f xs)) a ~= f a -> K (NS f xs) a ~= f a -> NS f xs
--
-- If we pick @a@ to be an element of @xs@, this indeed corresponds to an
-- injection into the sum.

-- | Apply injections to a product.
--
-- Given a product containing all possible choices, produce a
-- list of sums by applying each injection to the appropriate
-- element.
--
-- /Example:/

-- >>> apInjs_NP (I 'x' :* I True :* I 2 :* Nil)
-- [Z (I 'x'), S (Z (I True)), S (S (Z (I 2)))]

-- | Apply injections to a product of product.
--
-- This operates on the outer product only. Given a product

-- /Example:/
--
-- >>> apInjs_POP (POP ((I 'x' :* Nil) :* (I True :* I 2 :* Nil) :* Nil))
